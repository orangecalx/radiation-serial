Radiation-serial
----------------------------

these are a handful of logging scripts for <a href="https://mightyohm.com/blog/products/geiger-counter/">MightyOhm's fantastic geiger counter</a>. <br><br>

broadly speaking the goal is to use the geiger counter as a source of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_random_number_generator#Physical_phenomena_with_random_properties">truly random numbers</a> for my own ostensibly useful purposes. currently
the data is sourced mainly from background radiation here in my bedroom.
